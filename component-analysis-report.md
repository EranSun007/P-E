   - **Usage Pattern**: Confirmation dialog
   - **Implementation**: Lazy load when deletion is triggered

### Medium Priority (Consider for Splitting)

3. **OutOfOfficeManager** (20 KB)
   - **Impact**: Medium - Feature-specific component
   - **Usage Pattern**: Team management feature
   - **Implementation**: Lazy load in team member profiles

4. **WeeklyMeetingSidebar** (20 KB)
   - **Impact**: Medium - Calendar-specific feature
   - **Usage Pattern**: Conditionally rendered sidebar
   - **Implementation**: Lazy load when sidebar is opened

5. **MeetingDetailView** (16 KB)
   - **Impact**: Medium - Modal component
   - **Usage Pattern**: Calendar meeting details
   - **Implementation**: Lazy load when meeting is clicked

6. **OutOfOfficeForm** (16 KB)
   - **Impact**: Medium - Modal form component

### Low Priority (Not Recommended for Splitting)

- **UI Sidebar** (24 KB) - Core navigation component
- **TaskCard** (16 KB) - Frequently used core component
- **TaskFilterBar** (12 KB) - Core task management component
- **DutyCard** (12 KB) - Frequently used in profiles

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Impact Components
1. TaskCreationForm - Lazy load in task creation modal
2. TeamMemberDeletionDialog - Lazy load on deletion trigger

### Phase 2: Feature-Specific Components
3. OutOfOfficeManager - Lazy load in team management
4. WeeklyMeetingSidebar - Lazy load when sidebar opens
5. MeetingDetailView - Lazy load on meeting click

### Phase 3: Form Components
6. OutOfOfficeForm - Lazy load in form dialogs
7. DutyForm - Lazy load in duty management
8. UI Chart - Lazy load in Metrics page

## Expected Impact

### Bundle Size Reduction
- **Immediate Impact**: ~40 KB reduction (TaskCreationForm + TeamMemberDeletionDialog)
- **Full Implementation**: ~100+ KB reduction across all components
- **Initial Bundle**: Reduced by removing rarely-used large components

### Performance Benefits
- **Faster Initial Load**: Smaller initial bundle size
- **On-Demand Loading**: Components loaded only when needed
- **Better Caching**: Separate chunks for feature-specific components

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Proper Suspense boundaries for smooth transitions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for failed component loads
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality loads first

## Technical Considerations

### Loading Patterns
- Modal/Dialog components: Ideal for lazy loading
- Feature-specific components: Good candidates
- Core UI components: Should remain in main bundle

### Bundle Strategy
- Keep frequently used components in main bundle
- Split large, infrequently used components
- Group related components in feature chunks

### Error Handling
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed loads
- Provide fallback components for critical features
- Graceful degradation for non-essential components
