# P&E Manager - Development Workflow

## Development Philosophy

### Discovery-Driven Development
This project follows a unique development approach optimized for rapid learning and iteration:

**Daily Iteration Cycle:**
1. Use the system throughout the management day
2. Identify gaps, inefficiencies, or insights
3. Implement improvements immediately
4. Deploy and test in real usage
5. Capture learnings for next iteration

**AI-Assisted Development:**
- Leverage AI tools for code generation and optimization
- Use AI for testing strategy and implementation
- AI-driven documentation and code organization
- Smaller files and focused components for better AI comprehension

## File Organization for AI Tools

### Optimal File Structure
To maximize AI tool effectiveness, follow these guidelines:

**File Size Guidelines:**
- Keep components under 150 lines when possible
- Extract complex logic into separate utility files
- Break large pages into smaller, focused components
- Create dedicated hook files for reusable logic

**Naming Conventions:**
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/              # Basic UI components (< 50 lines each)
│   ├── forms/           # Form-specific components
│   ├── tables/          # Table and list components
│   └── layout/          # Layout and navigation components
├── pages/
│   ├── dashboard/       # Dashboard-related pages
│   ├── teams/           # Team management pages
│   ├── projects/        # Project management pages
│   └── meetings/        # Meeting management pages
├── hooks/
│   ├── useProjects.js   # Project-specific logic
│   ├── useTeams.js      # Team-specific logic
│   └── useMeetings.js   # Meeting-specific logic
├── services/
│   ├── storage/         # Data persistence layer
│   ├── validation/      # Form and data validation
│   └── utils/           # General utilities
└── types/               # TypeScript definitions (when migrating)
```

### Component Extraction Guidelines

**When to Extract:**
- Component exceeds 100 lines
- Logic is reused in multiple places
- Component has multiple responsibilities
- AI tools struggle to understand component purpose

**Example Extraction:**
```javascript
// Before: Large component
const ProjectManagement = () => {
  // 200+ lines of project logic, form handling, and UI
}

// After: Extracted components
const ProjectManagement = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ProjectHeader />
      <ProjectForm />
      <ProjectList />
      <ProjectMetrics />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## AI-Assisted Development Process

### Feature Development Workflow

**1. Feature Planning with AI**
```bash
# Use Claude Code to plan features
/ask "I need to add goal tracking to one-on-ones. What's the best approach given our current architecture?"
```

**2. Code Generation**
- Use AI to generate component scaffolding
- AI-assisted form validation and testing
- Automated test case generation

**3. Code Review with AI**
```bash
# Get AI feedback on implementation
/review "Check this component for best practices and potential improvements"
```

**4. Documentation Generation**
- AI-generated component documentation
- Automated README updates
- Code comment generation

### Testing Strategy

**AI-Driven Testing:**
- Generate test cases based on component functionality
- AI-assisted mock data creation
- Automated edge case identification

**Testing Levels:**
```javascript
// Unit Tests (AI-generated)
describe('TaskManager', () => {
  it('should create task with proper validation', () => {
    // AI generates comprehensive test cases
  })
})

// Integration Tests
describe('Project-Team Integration', () => {
  it('should connect team members to project tasks', () => {
    // Test the core people-project connection
  })
})

// User Workflow Tests
describe('Manager Daily Workflow', () => {
  it('should handle complete meeting preparation flow', () => {
    // Test real management scenarios
  })
})
```

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Guidelines

**Component Standards:**
- Single responsibility principle
- Props interface clearly defined
- Error boundaries for resilience
- Loading and error states handled

**Hook Standards:**
- Custom hooks for complex state logic
- Proper dependency arrays
- Error handling and cleanup
- Memoization for performance

**Service Standards:**
- Clear API interfaces
- Error handling and validation
- Consistent data transformation
- Future-proofed for cloud migration

### Documentation Standards

**Component Documentation:**
```javascript
/**
 * TaskForm - Create and edit tasks with full validation
 * 
 * Connects to: Projects, Teams, Stakeholders
 * Used in: Task management, Project planning, Meeting prep
 * 
 * @param {Object} task - Existing task for editing (optional)
 * @param {Function} onSave - Callback when task is saved
 * @param {boolean} isProject - Whether task is project-level
 */
const TaskForm = ({ task, onSave, isProject }) => {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Decision Documentation:**
- Capture architectural decisions immediately
- Document why choices were made, not just what
- Include alternatives considered
- Update as decisions evolve

## Deployment Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Daily development cycle
npm run dev          # Start development server

- Component-level lazy loading for large features
- Manual chunking for vendor libraries
- Automated bundle size monitoring

**Bundle Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
# Bundle analysis and monitoring
npm run analyze                    # Detailed bundle size analysis
npm run bundle:visual             # Interactive bundle explorer
npm run bundle:report             # Complete bundle analysis report
npm run test:bundle               # Bundle size regression tests
npm run test:loading-performance  # Loading performance validation
npm run test:optimization         # Full optimization test suite

# Real-time monitoring
node scripts/bundle-monitoring-dashboard.js  # Bundle monitoring dashboard
node scripts/bundle-monitoring-dashboard.js alert  # CI/CD alerts
```

**Performance Budgets:**
- Maximum chunk size: 400 kB
- Initial bundle size: <300 kB
- Route chunks: <150 kB each
- Total bundle size: <2 MB

### AI-Assisted Optimization
