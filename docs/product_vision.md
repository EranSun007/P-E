# P&E Manager - Product Vision

## Mission Statement

To create a unified management system that connects people development with engineering capacity, enabling P&E managers to have complete context for every decision and interaction.

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Pain Points

**Fragmented Management Tools:**
- People management tools (performance, development, OOO) are separate from project management
- No connection between individual growth and project impact
- Context switching between multiple systems throughout the day
- Information silos that prevent holistic decision making

**Lack of Unified Context:**
- Preparing for meetings requires checking multiple systems
- Historical insights from previous meetings are scattered
- No single source of truth for team capacity and development
- Difficulty connecting people development to business outcomes

**Rigid Tool Limitations:**
- Existing tools (Asana, Monday.com) are built with fixed feature sets
- Cannot adapt tools to unique management style and evolving needs
- Top-down design doesn't reflect individual manager workflows
- Limited ability to customize and extend functionality
