# P&E Manager Product Overview

P&E Manager, which stands for Products & Engineering, is a local-first productivity and team management application tailored for professionals who juggle both product and engineering responsibilities. By combining all aspects of product management, engineering oversight, and team coordination into a single tool, it eliminates the need for multiple disconnected applications. This makes it ideal for those who need a unified approach to managing people, processes, and products seamlessly.

## Key Features

- **Unified Task Management**: At the heart of P&E Manager is a powerful to-do list system that consolidates tasks from various sources—whether they come from one-on-one meetings with team members, interactions with stakeholders, or ongoing project requirements. This ensures that all responsibilities are visible in one place, making it easier to stay on top of what needs to be done.
- **Integrated Project Oversight**: Seamlessly manage multiple projects and products, with tasks automatically linked to their respective initiatives. The unified calendar view helps in visualizing deadlines, meetings, and important milestones, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
- **Performance Metrics & Analytics**: Track not only the progress of your products but also your personal task completion rates. This data-driven approach helps you continuously improve productivity and efficiency.

## Data Storage

In the current development phase, P&E Manager uses local storage in the browser to facilitate easy iteration and testing without the complexities of data migration. This approach allows for a more flexible and dynamic environment as the data model and workflows are still being refined. However, the ultimate goal is to transition to a cloud database, such as Postgres, once the app’s features and processes are solidified. This ensures that the app will ultimately support more robust and scalable data management while meeting the long-term needs of its users.

## Target Users

P&E Manager is designed for professionals who operate in layered circles of responsibility. At the core are the project managers and team leads who directly manage their teams, followed by peers and stakeholders who contribute tasks and requirements. Finally, at the outermost layer are the projects themselves, which integrate all these inputs into a cohesive workflow. This tool is ideal for small to medium development teams, organizations that value structured and layered task management, and teams that need a streamlined approach to handle multiple responsibilities seamlessly.
