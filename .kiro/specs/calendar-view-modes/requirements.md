# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds multiple view modes to the existing calendar functionality, allowing users to filter and view different types of events separately or combined. The calendar will display meetings, employee out-of-office periods, duties (like DevOps or on-call responsibilities), birthdays, and a combined view of all events. The calendar will also implement real-time updates to reflect changes when meetings are rescheduled or modified.
