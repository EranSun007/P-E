# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The P&E Manager application is experiencing bundle size warnings during the build process, with some chunks exceeding 500 kB after minification. This impacts initial load performance and user experience. We need to implement comprehensive bundle optimization strategies including dynamic imports, manual chunking, and build configuration adjustments to improve application performance and reduce bundle sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly on initial visit, so that I can start using the management features without delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN no chunks SHALL exceed 500 kB after minification
2. WHEN a user visits the application for the first time THEN the initial bundle size SHALL be under 300 kB
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the Time to Interactive (TTI) SHALL be under 3 seconds on 3G networks
4. WHEN subsequent pages are navigated THEN they SHALL load within 1 second due to code splitting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement dynamic imports for route-based code splitting, so that only necessary code is loaded for each page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a specific page THEN only that page's code SHALL be loaded initially
2. WHEN implementing route splitting THEN each major page (Calendar, Tasks, Team, Projects, etc.) SHALL be in separate chunks
3. WHEN a route is accessed THEN its dependencies SHALL be loaded on-demand
4. WHEN route chunks are created THEN they SHALL be properly named for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure manual chunking for vendor libraries, so that third-party dependencies are optimally grouped and cached.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN React and React-DOM SHALL be in a separate vendor chunk
2. WHEN building the application THEN UI libraries (Radix, Lucide) SHALL be grouped in a ui-vendor chunk
3. WHEN building the application THEN utility libraries (date-fns, class-variance-authority) SHALL be in a utils-vendor chunk
4. WHEN vendor chunks are created THEN they SHALL be cacheable across application updates
5. WHEN manual chunks are configured THEN chunk sizes SHALL be balanced (no chunk over 400 kB)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement component-level code splitting for large feature areas, so that complex components are loaded only when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large components are identified THEN they SHALL use React.lazy for dynamic loading
2. WHEN component splitting is implemented THEN loading states SHALL be provided with Suspense
3. WHEN feature components exceed 50 kB THEN they SHALL be candidates for code splitting
4. WHEN splitting components THEN error boundaries SHALL handle loading failures gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the build configuration, so that the bundling process produces the most efficient output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Vite THEN the chunk size warning limit SHALL be set to 400 kB
2. WHEN building THEN tree shaking SHALL be enabled for all dependencies
3. WHEN building THEN unused code SHALL be eliminated from the final bundle
4. WHEN configuring chunks THEN the build SHALL generate a bundle analysis report
5. WHEN optimizing THEN the build process SHALL maintain current build speed performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze and monitor bundle sizes, so that I can track optimization progress and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN a bundle size analysis report SHALL be generated
2. WHEN the build completes THEN chunk sizes SHALL be displayed in the console
3. WHEN analyzing bundles THEN the largest dependencies SHALL be identified
4. WHEN monitoring THEN build size changes SHALL be trackable over time
5. WHEN implementing optimizations THEN before/after metrics SHALL be measurable
