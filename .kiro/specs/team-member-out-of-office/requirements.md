# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Out of Office functionality to the Team Member entity, allowing employees to mark periods when they are not in the office with specific reasons. The system will track these periods, display counters on team member profiles, and provide calendar integration with aggregated views and detailed popups.
