# Design Document

## Overview

The Out of Office feature extends the existing Team Member entity to track periods when employees are unavailable. The design integrates seamlessly with the current team management system, calendar view, and team member profiles while maintaining consistency with existing UI patterns and data structures.

## Architecture

### Data Layer
The feature follows the existing entity pattern using the local client architecture. A new `OutOfOffice` entity will be created alongside existing entities like `TeamMember`, `Task`, and `OneOnOne`.

### Component Layer
New components will be built using the established UI component library (shadcn/ui) and follow existing patterns from team member management and calendar functionality.

### Integration Points
- **Team Member Profile**: Display out of office counter and management interface
- **Team Page**: Show current out of office status indicators
- **Calendar Page**: Display aggregated out of office information with interactive popups
- **Navigation**: Seamless integration with existing routing patterns

## Components and Interfaces

### Data Models

#### OutOfOffice Entity
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  team_member_id: string,
  start_date: string, // ISO date string
  end_date: string,   // ISO date string

  notes: string,      // optional additional details
  created_date: string,
  updated_date: string
}
```

#### OutOfOfficeReason Configuration
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,       // display name
  value: string,      // internal value
  active: boolean,    // whether this reason is available for new entries
  color: string,      // hex color for UI display
  order: number       // display order
}
```

### Service Layer

#### OutOfOfficeService
**Location**: `src/services/outOfOfficeService.js`
**Purpose**: Business logic for out of office operations
**Methods**:
- `calculateDaysInPeriod(startDate, endDate)` - Calculate total days including weekends
- `getActivePeriodsForDate(date)` - Get all active periods for specific date
- `getYearlyStats(teamMemberId, year)` - Get statistics for calendar year
- `validatePeriod(startDate, endDate)` - Validate date range
- `checkOverlaps(teamMemberId, startDate, endDate, excludeId)` - Check for overlapping periods

## Data Models

### Database Schema Extensions

The existing local client storage will be extended to include out of office data:

```javascript
// Added to localClient entity definitions
OutOfOffice: {
  tableName: 'out_of_office',
  fields: {
    id: { type: 'string', primary: true },
    team_member_id: { type: 'string', required: true, foreign: 'TeamMember.id' },
    start_date: { type: 'string', required: true },
    end_date: { type: 'string', required: true },
    reason: { type: 'string', required: true },
    notes: { type: 'string' },
    created_date: { type: 'string', required: true },
    updated_date: { type: 'string', required: true }
  }
}
```

### Data Relationships

- **OutOfOffice â†’ TeamMember**: Many-to-one relationship via `team_member_id`
- **OutOfOffice periods**: Can overlap for the same team member (with warnings)
- **Calendar integration**: Out of office periods appear as calendar events

## Error Handling

### Validation Rules
1. **Date Validation**: End date must be after or equal to start date
2. **Required Fields**: team_member_id, start_date, end_date, reason are required
3. **Date Format**: All dates must be valid ISO strings
4. **Reason Validation**: Must be from predefined list of active reasons

### Error States
- **Network Errors**: Graceful degradation with retry options
- **Validation Errors**: Clear field-level error messages
- **Conflict Warnings**: Non-blocking warnings for overlapping periods
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during data operations

### Error Messages
```javascript
const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  INVALID_DATE_RANGE: "End date must be after start date",
  REQUIRED_FIELD: "This field is required",
  NETWORK_ERROR: "Unable to save changes. Please try again.",
  OVERLAP_WARNING: "This period overlaps with an existing out of office period"
};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **OutOfOfficeService**: Test all business logic methods
- **Date calculations**: Verify day counting accuracy
- **Validation logic**: Test all validation rules
- **Component rendering**: Test UI component states

### Integration Tests
- **API operations**: Test CRUD operations with local client
- **Calendar integration**: Test calendar display and interactions
- **Team member profile**: Test counter updates and management interface
- **Cross-component communication**: Test data flow between components
