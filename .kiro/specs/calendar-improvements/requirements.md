# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses several critical issues and enhancements needed for the calendar functionality in the P&E Manager application. The current calendar implementation has problems with displaying future and past meetings, missing 1:1 meeting visibility, lacks a weekly meeting overview, needs better visual differentiation between event types, and requires recurring birthday events. These improvements will significantly enhance the user experience and make the calendar more functional and informative.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my meetings (past, present, and future) in the calendar view, so that I can have a complete overview of my schedule and track meeting history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the calendar THEN the system SHALL display all calendar events regardless of their date (past, present, or future)
2. WHEN I navigate to different months THEN the system SHALL load and display events for those time periods
3. WHEN 1:1 meetings are scheduled through the OneOnOne entity THEN they SHALL appear as calendar events in the calendar view
4. WHEN I view a specific date THEN the system SHALL show all events for that date including past events for historical reference

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a weekly overview of upcoming meetings on the right side of the calendar, so that I can quickly identify what meetings I have coming up this week.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the calendar page THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar on the right showing upcoming meetings for the current week
2. WHEN the current week changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the weekly meeting list
3. WHEN I click on a meeting in the weekly overview THEN the system SHALL navigate to that date and highlight the meeting
4. WHEN there are no meetings for the current week THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
5. WHEN meetings span multiple days THEN the system SHALL show them appropriately in the weekly overview

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want different types of calendar events to have distinct colors and visual styling, so that I can quickly identify the type of event at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view calendar events THEN each event type SHALL have a unique color scheme and visual styling
2. WHEN I view 1:1 meetings THEN they SHALL be displayed with orange/amber colors and a user icon
3. WHEN I view birthday events THEN they SHALL be displayed with pink colors and a cake icon
4. WHEN I view duty assignments THEN they SHALL be displayed with purple colors and a shield icon
5. WHEN I view out-of-office events THEN they SHALL be displayed with orange colors and a user-x icon
6. WHEN I view regular meetings THEN they SHALL be displayed with blue colors and a calendar icon
7. WHEN I view the event legend or tooltip THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the event type with appropriate visual cues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want birthday events to automatically recur every year, so that I don't have to manually create them annually and never miss team member birthdays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a team member's birthday is set THEN the system SHALL automatically create recurring birthday events for multiple years
2. WHEN I view the calendar in future years THEN birthday events SHALL appear automatically without manual intervention
3. WHEN a team member's birthday date is updated THEN the system SHALL update all future recurring birthday events accordingly
4. WHEN a team member is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated recurring birthday events
5. WHEN I view a birthday event THEN it SHALL clearly indicate it's a recurring annual event
6. WHEN the birthday event generation runs THEN it SHALL create events for at least the current year and next year
