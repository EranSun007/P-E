# Design Document

## Overview

The Peer Management feature will create a parallel system to the existing Team Member functionality, specifically designed for managing colleagues outside the user's direct team. This system will duplicate the core functionality of team member management while maintaining clear separation between internal team members and external peers.

The feature will leverage the existing architecture patterns established by the Team Member system, including the same data storage mechanisms, UI components (with appropriate modifications), and integration points with agenda items, out-of-office tracking, and calendar functionality.

## Architecture

### Data Layer
The peer management system will follow the same architectural patterns as the existing team member system:

- **Local Storage**: Peers will be stored in localStorage under the key `peers`
- **Entity Structure**: A new `Peer` entity will be created in the localClient with identical CRUD operations to TeamMember
- **Data Model**: Peers will have the same base fields as team members with additional peer-specific fields

### Component Architecture
The system will create peer-specific versions of existing team components:

- **Pages**: `Peers.jsx` (duplicate of `Team.jsx`) and `PeerProfile.jsx` (duplicate of `TeamMemberProfile.jsx`)
- **Components**: Peer-specific versions of team components in `src/components/peer/`
- **Services**: Peer-specific services that mirror team member services
- **API Integration**: Peer entity that mirrors TeamMember entity structure

### Navigation Integration
- New navigation entry for "Peers" alongside "Team"
- Peer profile pages with similar URL structure: `/peer-profile?id={peerId}`
- Breadcrumb navigation between peer list and individual profiles

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components

#### 1. Peer Entity (`src/api/entities.js`)
```javascript
export const Peer = localClient.entities.Peer;
```

#### 2. Peer LocalClient Entity (`src/api/localClient.js`)
```javascript
Peer: {
  async list() { return getData('peers'); },
  async get(id) { /* get single peer */ },
  async create(peer) { /* create new peer */ },
  async update(id, updates) { /* update peer */ },
  async delete(id) { /* delete peer */ }
}
```

#### 3. Main Peer Management Page (`src/pages/Peers.jsx`)
- Duplicate of `Team.jsx` with peer-specific terminology
- Search and filter functionality for peers
- Add/edit/delete peer operations
- Integration with agenda items and out-of-office status

#### 4. Peer Profile Page (`src/pages/PeerProfile.jsx`)
- Duplicate of `TeamMemberProfile.jsx` with peer-specific context
- 1:1 meeting tracking with peers
- Agenda item management
- Out-of-office status tracking
- Action item management

#### 5. Peer-Specific Components (`src/components/peer/`)
- `PeerCard.jsx` - Individual peer display card
- `PeerForm.jsx` - Add/edit peer form
- `PeerOutOfOfficeManager.jsx` - Out-of-office management for peers
- `PeerAgendaBadge.jsx` - Agenda item badge for peers

### Interface Definitions

#### Peer Data Model
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  role: string,
  email: string,
  phone: string,
  organization: string,        // New field - peer's organization/company
  department: string,
  collaboration_context: string, // New field - nature of collaboration
  relationship_type: string,   // New field - type of peer relationship
  availability: string,
  skills: string[],
  notes: string,
  avatar: string,
  created_date: string,
  last_activity: string
}
```

#### Relationship Types
- `cross_team` - Colleague from another team in same organization
- `external_partner` - External partner or vendor
- `client_contact` - Client or customer contact
- `contractor` - External contractor or consultant
- `other` - Other type of professional relationship

## Data Models

### Peer Entity Schema
The Peer entity will mirror the TeamMember schema with additional fields:

```javascript
{
  // Base fields (same as TeamMember)
  id: "uuid",
  name: "string (required)",
  role: "string",
  email: "string",
  phone: "string",
  department: "string",
  availability: "enum [full_time, part_time, contractor, remote]",
  skills: "array of strings",
  notes: "string",
  avatar: "string (URL)",
  created_date: "ISO string",
  
  // Peer-specific fields
  organization: "string", // Company or organization name
  collaboration_context: "string", // Description of collaboration
  relationship_type: "enum [cross_team, external_partner, client_contact, contractor, other]"
}
```

### Storage Structure
- **Key**: `peers` in localStorage
- **Format**: Array of peer objects
- **Indexing**: By ID for quick lookups
- **Relationships**: Referenced by agenda items, 1:1 meetings, and out-of-office records

### Data Relationships
- **OneOnOne Meetings**: Peers can have 1:1 meetings (using `peer_id` instead of `team_member_id`)
- **Agenda Items**: Can be tagged with peer references
- **Out-of-Office**: Peers can have out-of-office status tracking
- **Calendar Integration**: Peer meetings can be integrated with calendar events

## Error Handling

### Data Validation
- Required field validation (name is mandatory)
- Email format validation
- Phone number format validation
- Relationship type enum validation
- Skills array validation

### Error States
- **Network Errors**: Handle localStorage access failures
- **Validation Errors**: Display field-specific error messages
- **Not Found Errors**: Handle missing peer records gracefully
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevent duplicate peer entries by email

### User Feedback
- Success messages for CRUD operations
- Loading states during data operations
- Error alerts with actionable messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Peer Entity Tests**: CRUD operations, validation, error handling
- **Component Tests**: Peer form validation, display logic, user interactions
- **Service Tests**: Peer-specific business logic and data transformations

### Integration Tests
- **Peer-Agenda Integration**: Test agenda item tagging with peers
- **Peer-Calendar Integration**: Test calendar event creation for peer meetings
- **Peer-OutOfOffice Integration**: Test out-of-office status management
- **Navigation Tests**: Test routing between peer list and profile pages

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for peer-related components
- All CRUD operations must have corresponding tests
- Error scenarios must be tested
- User interaction flows must be tested

## Implementation Considerations

### Code Reuse Strategy
- Maximum reuse of existing team member components through abstraction
- Shared utility functions for common operations
- Consistent styling and UX patterns
- Shared validation and error handling logic

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of peer data
- Efficient filtering and search algorithms
- Minimal re-renders through proper state management
- Optimized localStorage operations

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for peer-specific content
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance

### Internationalization
- Peer-specific terminology that can be localized
- Relationship type labels that support translation
- Date and time formatting for different locales

## Migration and Compatibility

### Data Migration
- No migration needed as this is a new feature
- Existing team member data remains unchanged
- Clear separation between peers and team members

### Backward Compatibility
- No impact on existing team member functionality
- Existing agenda items and meetings remain unchanged
- New peer references are additive only

### Future Extensibility
- Support for peer groups or categories
- Integration with external contact management systems
- Advanced collaboration tracking features
- Peer relationship analytics and insights
