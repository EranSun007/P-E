# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a "Peers" management system that allows users to track and manage colleagues they work with regularly who are not part of their direct team. This system will provide the same core functionality as the existing team member management but specifically for cross-team collaborators, external partners, and other professional contacts that require regular coordination.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage a list of peers (colleagues outside my team), so that I can track and coordinate with people I work with regularly across different teams or organizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Peers section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all my registered peers
2. WHEN I view the peers list THEN the system SHALL show each peer's name, role, organization/team, and current status
3. WHEN I click on a peer THEN the system SHALL navigate to their detailed profile page
4. WHEN I add a new peer THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify their name, role, organization/team, contact information, and relationship context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed peer profiles, so that I can access comprehensive information about colleagues I collaborate with regularly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access a peer's profile THEN the system SHALL display their complete information including name, role, organization, contact details, and collaboration context
2. WHEN I view a peer's profile THEN the system SHALL show their current availability status and any out-of-office information
3. WHEN I am on a peer's profile THEN the system SHALL provide options to edit their information or remove them from my peers list
4. IF a peer has upcoming meetings or shared agenda items THEN the system SHALL display this information on their profile

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track peer availability and out-of-office status, so that I can plan collaborations and meetings effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view peer information THEN the system SHALL display their current availability status (available, busy, out-of-office)
2. WHEN a peer is out-of-office THEN the system SHALL show their return date and any coverage information
3. WHEN I set out-of-office information for a peer THEN the system SHALL store the start date, end date, and optional notes
4. WHEN multiple peers are out-of-office THEN the system SHALL provide a summary count and overview

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to associate agenda items and tasks with specific peers, so that I can track collaboration items and meeting topics by person.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create an agenda item THEN the system SHALL allow me to tag it with one or more peers
2. WHEN I view a peer's profile THEN the system SHALL display all agenda items and tasks associated with that peer
3. WHEN I filter agenda items by peer THEN the system SHALL show only items tagged with the selected peer
4. WHEN I remove a peer THEN the system SHALL handle the reassignment or removal of associated agenda items appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage peer relationships independently from team members, so that I can maintain separate organizational contexts for different types of professional relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Peers section THEN the system SHALL maintain it as a separate entity from the Team Members section
2. WHEN I perform peer management actions THEN the system SHALL not affect team member data or functionality
3. WHEN I search or filter THEN the system SHALL allow me to distinguish between peers and team members
4. IF I need to convert a peer to a team member or vice versa THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate migration functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add contextual information about my peer relationships, so that I can remember the nature and scope of each collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add or edit a peer THEN the system SHALL allow me to specify the collaboration context (project, department, external partner, etc.)
2. WHEN I view peer information THEN the system SHALL display the relationship context and collaboration scope
3. WHEN I have multiple collaboration contexts with the same peer THEN the system SHALL support multiple relationship tags or categories
4. WHEN I organize my peers THEN the system SHALL allow filtering and grouping by relationship context
