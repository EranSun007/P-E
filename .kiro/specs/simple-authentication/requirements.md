# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a simple username/password authentication system to protect the application from unauthorized access. The system will require users to authenticate before accessing any application content, ensuring that only authorized users can view and interact with the app when deployed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an application owner, I want to require authentication before users can access the app, so that unauthorized users cannot view sensitive content when the app is deployed publicly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application URL THEN the system SHALL display a login form before showing any application content
2. WHEN a user has not authenticated THEN the system SHALL prevent access to all protected routes and components
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL check for existing authentication state and redirect accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with a username and password, so that I can access the application content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and grant access to the application
2. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent access
3. WHEN a user submits empty credentials THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
4. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL remember the authentication state during the session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication to persist during my session, so that I don't have to re-login every time I navigate or refresh the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store authentication state in localStorage
2. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL check localStorage for existing authentication state
3. WHEN a user closes and reopens the browser tab THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication state via localStorage
4. WHEN a user navigates between different pages THEN the system SHALL preserve authentication state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log out of the application, so that I can securely end my session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL clear authentication state and redirect to login
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL prevent access to protected content until re-authentication
3. WHEN a user attempts to access protected routes after logout THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an application owner, I want to configure the authentication credentials, so that I can control who has access to the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is configured THEN the system SHALL use predefined username and password credentials
2. WHEN credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL validate user input against these stored credentials
3. IF no credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL use secure default credentials that must be changed
