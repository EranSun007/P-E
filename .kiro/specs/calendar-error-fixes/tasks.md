# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix CalendarSynchronizationService undefined results variable
  - Locate the syncOneOnOneMeetings method in src/services/calendarSynchronizationService.js
  - Identify where the `results` variable should be declared at line 247
  - Add proper variable initialization and error handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Fix RecurringBirthdayService undefined createdEvents variable
  - Locate the ensureBirthdayEventsExist method in src/services/recurringBirthdayService.js
  - Initialize `createdEvents` variable at line 409 and throughout the method
  - Ensure proper event tracking and return accurate counts
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Improve CalendarService date validation logic
  - Review the _validateDateTime method in src/services/calendarService.js at line 188
  - Fix timezone handling and current time comparison logic
  - Add buffer time for near-current dates to prevent edge case rejections
  - Improve error messages to include actual date being validated
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Fix React toast component prop warnings
  - Locate toast components in src/components/ui/toast.jsx
  - Replace `onOpenChange` with correct prop name for the component library
  - Test component rendering to ensure no React warnings
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Add defensive programming checks for variable initialization
  - Review all calendar service methods for potential undefined variable usage
  - Add runtime checks and optional chaining where appropriate
  - Implement proper error handling for undefined variables
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 6. Enhance error handling and retry logic
  - Improve retry logic to avoid infinite loops on validation errors
  - Add exponential backoff for transient errors
  - Distinguish between retryable and non-retryable errors in calendar operations
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.2_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive unit tests for fixed methods
  - Write tests for syncOneOnOneMeetings with proper results variable handling
  - Write tests for ensureBirthdayEventsExist with createdEvents tracking
  - Write tests for date validation edge cases and timezone handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 8. Test and validate all console errors are resolved
  - Run the application and verify no "results is not defined" errors
  - Verify no "createdEvents is not defined" errors in birthday sync
  - Verify no "dateTime cannot be in the past" validation loops
  - Verify no React prop warnings in console
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_
