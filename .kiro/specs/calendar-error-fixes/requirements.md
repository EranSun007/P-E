# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The calendar synchronization system is experiencing multiple JavaScript errors that prevent proper functionality. These errors include undefined variable references, date validation issues, and React prop warnings. This spec addresses fixing these critical errors to restore calendar system stability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calendar synchronization to work without JavaScript errors so that my one-on-one meetings and birthday events are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calendar synchronization service runs THEN it SHALL NOT throw "results is not defined" errors
2. WHEN syncOneOnOneMeetings is called THEN it SHALL properly declare and use the results variable
3. WHEN the background sync fails THEN it SHALL log meaningful error messages without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want birthday event synchronization to complete successfully so that team member birthdays are tracked in the calendar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ensureBirthdayEventsExist is called THEN it SHALL NOT throw "createdEvents is not defined" errors
2. WHEN birthday events are created THEN the createdEvents variable SHALL be properly initialized and used
3. WHEN birthday synchronization completes THEN it SHALL return accurate counts of created events

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want calendar event creation to handle date validation properly so that events are not rejected due to past dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating one-on-one meetings THEN the system SHALL validate that dateTime is not in the past
2. WHEN dateTime validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN retrying failed operations THEN the system SHALL use current or future dates only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want React components to use proper prop names so that there are no console warnings about unknown properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN toast components are rendered THEN they SHALL NOT generate "Unknown event handler property" warnings
2. WHEN onOpenChange is used THEN it SHALL be replaced with the correct prop name for the component library
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the console SHALL be free of React prop validation warnings
