# Design Document

## Overview

The One-on-One Agenda Management feature enhances the P&E Manager application by providing managers with tools to prepare for 1:1 meetings with team members and maintain personal performance files. This design document outlines the architecture, components, data models, and implementation strategy for this feature.

## Architecture

The feature will be implemented within the existing React application architecture, leveraging the current component structure, data storage mechanisms, and UI patterns. The implementation will focus on two main functional areas:

1. **1:1 Meeting Agenda Management**: Allows managers to add, view, and manage agenda items for upcoming 1:1 meetings with team members.
2. **Personal Performance File**: Enables managers to save and organize items related to team members' performance for year-end reviews.

Both features will be integrated into the existing team member profile views and accessible from multiple contexts within the application.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1:1 Agenda Components

   - State: expanded/collapsed, action menu open/closed

4. **AgendaSection**
   - Purpose: Container for agenda management in team member profile
   - Props: teamMemberId
   - State: view mode (list/calendar), filter options

### Personal File Components

   - Purpose: Save items to a team member's personal file
   - Props: teamMemberId, sourceItem (optional), onSubmit
   - State: form fields (title, notes, category, tags)

2. **PersonalFileList**
   - Purpose: Display and manage personal file items
   - Props: teamMemberId
   - State: loading, items, filter/sort options

3. **PersonalFileItemCard**

   - Props: item, onEdit, onDelete
   - State: expanded/collapsed

4. **PersonalFileSection**
   - Purpose: Container for personal file management in team member profile

### Integration Components

1. **TeamMemberProfileTabs**
   - Enhanced to include 1:1 Agenda and Personal File tabs
   - Provides navigation between different team member data views

2. **QuickActionMenu**
   - Enhanced to include "Add to 1:1 Agenda" and "Save to Personal File" options
   - Available in task views, calendar events, and other relevant contexts

## Data Models

### AgendaItem

```javascript
{
  id: String,                // Unique identifier
  teamMemberId: String,      // Associated team member
  title: String,             // Brief description
  description: String,       // Detailed notes
  createdAt: Date,           // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date,           // Last update timestamp
  priority: Number,          // Priority level (1-3)
  status: String,            // 'pending', 'discussed', 'moved'
  targetMeetingDate: Date,   // Intended meeting date
  tags: Array<String>        // Optional categorization
}
```

### PersonalFileItem

```javascript
{
  id: String,                // Unique identifier
  teamMemberId: String,      // Associated team member
  title: String,             // Brief description
  notes: String,             // Detailed content
  createdAt: Date,           // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date,           // Last update timestamp
  category: String,          // 'achievement', 'concern', 'feedback', 'goal', etc.
  sourceType: String,        // Origin type ('task', 'meeting', 'note', 'manual')
  sourceId: String,          // Reference to source item (if applicable)
  tags: Array<String>,       // Custom tags for filtering
  importance: Number         // Rating (1-5)
}
```

## Error Handling

1. **Form Validation**
   - Client-side validation for required fields
   - Appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

2. **Data Operations**
   - Error states for failed data operations
   - Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Handling of team member deletion/archiving
   - Management of orphaned agenda items
   - Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Component rendering and behavior
   - Form validation and submission
   - State management and data transformations

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Data flow between components
   - Interaction with localStorage API
   - Navigation and context switching

3. **User Flow Tests**
   - Complete agenda item creation and management
   - Personal file item creation and organization
   - Cross-context actions and data consistency

## UI/UX Considerations

1. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard navigation for all interactions
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Sufficient color contrast and text sizing

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-friendly layouts for all components
   - Touch-friendly interaction targets
   - Adaptive content display based on screen size

3. **User Feedback**
   - Toast notifications for successful actions
   - Loading indicators for async operations
   - Clear error messages and recovery options

## Integration Points

1. **Team Member Profile**
   - New tabs for 1:1 Agenda and Personal File
   - Context-aware actions in existing views

2. **Calendar View**
   - Indicators for 1:1 meetings with agenda items
   - Quick access to meeting preparation

3. **Task Management**
   - Actions to add tasks to 1:1 agenda
   - Options to save task-related information to personal files

4. **Global Navigation**
   - Access to upcoming 1:1 meetings
   - Notifications for pending agenda items
