-   Always ensure a product requirement document is there (prd.md) with high level requirement the steps. status should be approved. and it should be TDD based development -> test after every change to ensure the outcome is correct. if it's not there, take the requriements and generate the prd. 

-   ensure that the complete UI is geneated for the requirments and all UI is tested.

-   dont' assume anything, first ask user to verify the prd and if yes, then approve it, initial status should be pending. if users says approve or somethign similar, change the status, always work if the status is pending only.

    -   status: approved

```
[ ] step 1
[ ] step 2
[ ] step n
    [ ] substep 1
```

-   steps and substeps should be very detailed, ensure that the whoel application is complete - with UI and neccessary logic.

-   after every step completion, mark it as completed [X], for sub and main steps
