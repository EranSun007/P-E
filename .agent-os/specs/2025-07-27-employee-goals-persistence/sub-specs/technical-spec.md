# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-27-employee-goals-persistence/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Data Model**: Create EmployeeGoal entity with id, employeeId, title, developmentNeed, developmentActivity, developmentGoalDescription, createdAt, updatedAt fields
- **Storage Integration**: Extend existing local storage service layer to support goals persistence with proper versioning and migration
- **Form Validation**: Implement Zod schemas for goal data validation with support for optional fields and structured text content
- **UI Components**: Build reusable goal components using existing Radix UI patterns for consistency with current design system
- **Team Member Integration**: Extend existing team member data model to include goals relationship with proper foreign key handling
- **Import Functionality**: Create CSV/JSON import capability with field mapping interface for external data sources
- **Search and Filtering**: Implement goal search functionality within team member profiles for quick access to specific goals

## Approach Options

**Option A: Extend Existing Team Member Model**
- Pros: Leverages existing patterns, maintains data relationships, simpler queries
- Cons: Increases team member model complexity, potential performance impact

**Option B: Separate Goals Entity with Relations** (Selected)
- Pros: Clean separation of concerns, better scalability, independent goal management, easier testing
- Cons: More complex relationship management, additional joins for data retrieval

**Option C: Embedded Goals in Team Member Records**
- Pros: Simpler data structure, fewer queries, easy to implement
- Cons: Limited scalability, difficult to query goals independently, versioning challenges

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of maintainability and scalability. It follows the existing pattern of separate entities with relationships (like tasks and projects) and allows for future enhancements like goal analytics and cross-team goal tracking.

## External Dependencies

- **React Hook Form** - Already integrated for consistent form handling patterns
- **Justification:** Continue using established form patterns for goal creation and editing interfaces

- **Zod** - Already integrated for data validation
- **Justification:** Maintain consistent validation patterns across the application

- **date-fns** - Already integrated for date handling
- **Justification:** Required for goal creation timestamps and date-based tracking

## Data Architecture

### EmployeeGoal Entity Structure
```javascript
{
  id: string,                    // UUID for unique identification
  employeeId: string,            // Foreign key to team member
  title: string,                 // Main goal title
  developmentNeed: string,       // Skills/areas needing improvement
  developmentActivity: string,   // Specific planned activities
  developmentGoalDescription: string, // Detailed goal breakdown
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'paused', // Goal status
  createdAt: Date,              // Creation timestamp
  updatedAt: Date,              // Last modification timestamp
  importSource?: string         // Optional source system identifier
}
```

### Service Layer Extensions
- Extend existing storage service with goals-specific methods
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Add data migration support for future schema changes
- Include backup and restore functionality

### Integration Points
- Team member profile pages for goal display
- One-on-one meeting context for goal discussions
- Project assignment interface for goal-project connections
- Analytics dashboard for goal tracking metrics
