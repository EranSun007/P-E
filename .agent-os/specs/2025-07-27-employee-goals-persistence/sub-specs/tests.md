## Mocking Requirements

**Date/Time Services:** Mock current date for consistent goal creation timestamps and testing time-based features like goal age and deadline tracking

**Storage Service:** Mock local storage operations to test data persistence without browser dependencies and enable isolated unit testing

**Import File Operations:** Mock file reading and parsing to test import functionality with controlled data sets and error conditions

**Navigation/Routing:** Mock React Router navigation to test goal-related page transitions and URL handling

**Team Member Data:** Mock team member service to provide consistent test data for goal-to-employee relationships without depending on existing team data
