> Spec: Employee Goals Persistence System
> Created: 2025-07-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive employee goals persistence system that extracts and stores development goals from external systems, enabling tracking and evaluation of individual team member growth within the unified P&E management platform.

## User Stories

### External Goals Data Integration

As a P&E Manager, I want to import employee development goals from external HR systems, so that I can track individual growth objectives alongside project work and maintain a unified view of team development.

**Workflow:** Manager accesses goals import interface, selects data source or upload method, maps external goal fields to internal structure, reviews and confirms import, and sees goals integrated into team member profiles with immediate availability for tracking and evaluation.

### Development Goals Tracking

As a P&E Manager, I want to view and manage employee development goals with their structured components (title, development needs, activities, descriptions), so that I can provide targeted support and track progress during one-on-one meetings.

**Workflow:** Manager navigates to team member profile, views comprehensive goals overview with all structured fields, can edit or update goal status, and connects goals to specific projects or tasks for unified tracking across all management activities.

### Goal-Project Connection

As a P&E Manager, I want to connect employee development goals to active projects and tasks, so that I can ensure individual growth aligns with business objectives and track skill development through real work assignments.

**Workflow:** Manager reviews employee goals, identifies relevant projects that support goal achievement, creates explicit connections between goals and project work, and monitors progress through both goal completion and project delivery metrics.

## Spec Scope

1. **Goals Data Model** - Create comprehensive data structure supporting title, development need, development activity, and goal description fields
2. **Goals Storage System** - Implement persistent storage for goals data using existing local storage architecture with migration support
3. **Goals Import Interface** - Build user interface for importing goals from external sources with field mapping and validation
4. **Team Member Integration** - Connect goals data to existing team member profiles with seamless navigation and context switching
5. **Goals Management UI** - Create comprehensive interface for viewing, editing, and tracking goal progress with structured field display

## Out of Scope

- Real-time synchronization with external HR systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting on goal completion rates
- Automated goal recommendations or AI-powered insights
- Multi-level approval workflows for goal changes
- Integration with external performance review systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Goals Management System** - Complete browser-testable system where managers can import, store, view, and manage employee development goals
2. **Seamless Team Integration** - Goals data fully integrated into existing team member profiles with consistent UI patterns and navigation
3. **Persistent Data Storage** - All goals data persists across browser sessions using local storage with proper migration support for future cloud transition
