## Pitch

P&E Manager is a unified people and engineering management system that helps P&E managers seamlessly connect people development with engineering capacity by providing a single context platform for all management activities. This customizable, living system evolves with the manager's needs and eliminates context switching between fragmented tools.

## Users

## The Problem

### Fragmented Management Tools

People management tools (performance, development, OOO) are completely separate from project management systems. There's no connection between individual growth and project impact, forcing managers to constantly context switch between multiple systems throughout the day. This creates information silos that prevent holistic decision making.

**Our Solution:** Create a unified platform where all management data lives together, providing complete context for every interaction.

### Lack of Unified Context

Preparing for meetings requires checking multiple systems, historical insights from previous meetings are scattered across tools, and there's no single source of truth for team capacity and development. Managers struggle to connect people development to business outcomes.

**Our Solution:** Build a unified memory system that captures all management insights and makes them readily available.

### Rigid Tool Limitations

Existing tools like Asana and Monday.com are built with fixed feature sets that cannot adapt to unique management styles and evolving needs. These top-down designs don't reflect individual manager workflows and offer limited ability to customize and extend functionality.

**Our Solution:** Create a living, breathing system that managers can own, modify, and extend based on their real-world insights.

### Context Switching Overhead

Managers waste significant time switching between separate tools for tasks, projects, people development, meetings, and calendar management. Each tool has its own data model and interface, creating cognitive overhead.

**Our Solution:** Unify all management activities in a single, coherent system with connected data models.

## Differentiators

### People-Project Connection

Unlike traditional project management tools that focus solely on tasks and timelines, we provide the only system that truly connects people development with project delivery. This results in better decision-making and more meaningful team interactions.

### Living Architecture

Unlike rigid SaaS platforms, our system is owned and customizable by the manager, allowing daily feature additions based on real usage insights. This results in a tool that evolves with changing management needs.

### Unified Memory System

Unlike fragmented tools that create information silos, we provide a single context platform where all management data lives together. This results in complete context for every meeting and decision.
