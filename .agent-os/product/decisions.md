## 2025-07-26: Initial Product Planning and Agent OS Installation

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Establish P&E Manager as a unified people and engineering management system targeting P&E managers with 5-15 direct reports. The system connects people development with project delivery through a single context platform that evolves with manager needs.

### Context

Current management tools create fragmented experiences where people management (performance, development, OOO) exists separately from project management. P&E managers waste significant time context switching between systems and lack unified context for decision-making. Existing tools like Asana and Monday.com have rigid, top-down designs that don't adapt to individual management styles.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Customize Existing Tool (Asana/Monday.com)**
   - Pros: Faster initial setup, proven platform, existing integrations
   - Cons: Limited customization, can't connect people/project data, rigid feature set, ongoing subscription costs

2. **Build Simple Task Manager**
   - Pros: Quick to build, focused scope, easy maintenance
   - Cons: Doesn't solve core problem of fragmented tools, no people-project connection, limited growth potential

3. **Enterprise Solution (SAP SuccessFactors + Project Tool)**
   - Pros: Enterprise grade, comprehensive features, SAP integration
   - Cons: Massive complexity, expensive, doesn't solve unified context problem, requires extensive customization

### Rationale

Chose to build a unified system because no existing tool solves the core problem of connecting people development with project delivery. The custom approach allows for:
- Daily iteration based on real usage insights
- Complete control over data model and feature evolution  
- SAP ecosystem integration for future enterprise deployment
- Living architecture that adapts to changing management needs

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete control over feature development and data model
- Can capture all management work in single system
- Eliminates context switching between fragmented tools
- Enables unique people-project connections not possible in existing tools
- Foundation for future AI-powered management insights

**Negative:**
- Higher initial development investment than using existing tools
- Full responsibility for maintenance, security, and scaling
- Need to build features that exist in mature platforms
- Risk of scope creep and feature complexity

## 2025-07-26: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted  
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Selected React 18 + Vite + TailwindCSS + Radix UI for frontend with local storage for discovery phase, targeting SAP BTP deployment with future SAP HANA Cloud integration.

### Context

Need modern, fast development stack that enables rapid iteration during discovery phase while supporting future enterprise deployment on SAP infrastructure. Must balance development speed with long-term scalability.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Vue.js + Nuxt**
   - Pros: Simpler learning curve, excellent developer experience
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less SAP integration examples

2. **Angular + SAP UI5**
   - Pros: Native SAP integration, enterprise-focused, TypeScript by default
   - Cons: Slower development, heavyweight for discovery phase, complex architecture

3. **Next.js + React**
   - Pros: Full-stack capabilities, excellent developer experience, large ecosystem
   - Cons: Server complexity not needed for local storage phase, deployment complexity

### Rationale

React + Vite provides the fastest development iteration while maintaining flexibility for future growth. Local storage enables immediate experimentation without database complexity. TailwindCSS + Radix UI combination provides professional UI with minimal custom CSS. Path supports future SAP ecosystem integration.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Extremely fast development and build times with Vite
- Rich ecosystem and community support for React
- Professional UI components with Radix without design overhead
- Local storage eliminates database complexity during discovery
- Clear path to SAP HANA Cloud migration

**Negative:**
- Local storage limitations for data size and persistence
- No real-time collaboration capabilities initially
- Need custom data migration system for storage evolution
- React complexity higher than simpler alternatives

## 2025-07-26: Discovery Phase Data Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Use browser local storage for all data persistence during discovery phase with built-in migration system for future cloud transition.

### Context

Discovery phase requires rapid experimentation with data models and features. Traditional database setup would slow iteration speed. Need to validate product-market fit before investing in cloud infrastructure.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **SQLite Database**
   - Pros: Real database features, SQL queries, better data integrity
   - Cons: File system dependencies, deployment complexity, migration overhead

2. **JSON Files**
   - Pros: Simple to understand, easy backup/restore, version control friendly
   - Cons: No concurrent access, file system dependencies, manual data management

3. **Cloud Database (Immediate)**
   - Pros: Production-ready, real-time capabilities, proper backup/restore
   - Cons: Setup complexity, ongoing costs, slower iteration, premature optimization

### Rationale

Local storage provides immediate data persistence with zero setup complexity. Built-in migration system ensures smooth transition to cloud when ready. Allows focus on product validation rather than infrastructure concerns during critical discovery phase.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero database setup or configuration required
- Instant data persistence across browser sessions
- Can iterate on data models without migration complexity
- Built-in versioning system for smooth cloud transition
- No ongoing infrastructure costs during discovery

**Negative:**
- Data limited to single browser/device
- No automatic backup or sync capabilities
- Storage size limitations (5-10MB typical)
- Data loss risk if browser storage cleared
- No real-time collaboration possible

## 2025-07-26: Component Architecture Pattern

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt feature-based component organization with co-located tests, using Radix UI primitives with Tailwind styling, and React Hook Form + Zod for all form handling.

### Context

Need scalable component architecture that supports rapid feature development while maintaining code quality. Must balance developer productivity with long-term maintainability.

### Rationale

Feature-based organization keeps related code together, improving discoverability and maintenance. Radix UI provides accessible, well-tested primitives. React Hook Form + Zod combination provides excellent developer experience with runtime validation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear code organization by feature domain
- Comprehensive test coverage with co-located tests
- Accessible UI components out of the box
- Consistent form handling patterns across application
- Strong runtime validation with TypeScript-like experience

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for Radix UI component patterns
- Additional bundle size from comprehensive component library
- Potential over-engineering for simple forms
- Need to maintain consistent styling patterns
