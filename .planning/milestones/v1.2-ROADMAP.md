# Milestone v1.2: DevOps Bug Dashboard

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-28
**Phases:** 10-12
**Total Plans:** 5

## Overview

Add a bug KPI dashboard that analyzes weekly JIRA exports to track DevOps duty team performance with actionable metrics and alerts.

**Target features:**
- CSV upload with validation and duplicate detection
- 9 KPIs calculated per upload (bug inflow, TTFR, MTTR, SLA compliance, backlog health)
- Dashboard with KPI cards showing status (green/yellow/red)
- Filtering by component and week
- Critical alerts when thresholds breached
- Aging bugs table with direct JIRA links
- Charts: MTTR by priority, bug category distribution

## Phases

### Phase 10: Backend Foundation
**Goal:** Backend can store bug data, calculate KPIs, and serve analytics via REST API
**Depends on:** Phase 9 (v1.1 complete)
**Requirements:** DB-01, DB-02, DB-03, DB-04, DB-05, KPI-01 through KPI-09, API-02, API-03, API-04, API-05, UPLOAD-03
**Success Criteria:**
  1. Database tables (bug_uploads, bugs, weekly_kpis) exist with proper indexes
  2. BugService can parse CSV and validate required columns
  3. BugService calculates all 9 KPIs matching specification formulas
  4. GET /api/bugs/kpis returns pre-calculated KPIs for week + component
  5. GET /api/bugs/list returns bugs with filtering and pagination
  6. DELETE /api/bugs/uploads/:id cascades to bugs and KPIs
**Plans:** 2/2 complete

Plans:
- [x] 10-01-PLAN.md — Database schema, migration, and BugService foundation
- [x] 10-02-PLAN.md — KPI calculations and REST API routes

### Phase 11: CSV Upload
**Goal:** User can upload JIRA CSV exports with validation and progress feedback
**Depends on:** Phase 10 (backend must exist)
**Requirements:** UPLOAD-01, UPLOAD-02, UPLOAD-04, UPLOAD-05, UPLOAD-06, API-01
**Success Criteria:**
  1. User can upload CSV via drag-and-drop or file picker
  2. User must specify week-ending date (Saturday) for each upload
  3. System shows clear error messages for invalid CSV format
  4. Duplicate upload detection prompts for replace/cancel
  5. Upload progress and summary displayed (total bugs, components)
**Plans:** 1/1 complete

Plans:
- [x] 11-01-PLAN.md — Upload page with validation, progress, and duplicate detection

### Phase 12: Dashboard UI
**Goal:** User can view KPIs with status indicators, filters, alerts, and charts
**Depends on:** Phase 10 (API must exist), Phase 11 (data must be uploadable)
**Requirements:** DASH-01 through DASH-08
**Success Criteria:**
  1. Dashboard shows all KPIs in card layout with green/yellow/red status
  2. Filter by component dropdown updates all KPIs
  3. Filter by week dropdown loads historical data
  4. Critical alert banner appears when any KPI in red zone
  5. Aging bugs table shows open VH/High bugs with clickable JIRA links
  6. MTTR by priority bar chart renders correctly
  7. Bug category pie/donut chart renders correctly
**Plans:** 2/2 complete

Plans:
- [x] 12-01-PLAN.md — KPI cards with status colors, filter dropdowns, critical alert banner
- [x] 12-02-PLAN.md — Aging bugs table with JIRA links, MTTR bar chart, category donut chart

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- CSV upload as data source (no JIRA API access)
- 3-table schema: bug_uploads, bugs, weekly_kpis
- Pre-calculated KPIs stored in database for instant dashboard loads
- fast-csv for streaming CSV parsing
- XMLHttpRequest for upload progress (fetch lacks progress events)
- Saturday date snapping for better UX
- 5 actionable KPIs with thresholds, 4 informational KPIs

**Issues Resolved:**
- Multi-format date parsing handles JIRA locale variations
- Component extraction from labels/summary with priority ordering
- Navigation routing mismatch fixed (/bugs → /bugdashboard)

**Issues Deferred:**
- CSV date format parsing may need additional formats based on production exports
- Large CSV files (1000+ bugs) need performance testing

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
